                        <p>How do wind turbines and solar panels work together 
                            in a renewable energy system?
                        </p>
                        <p>Wind turbines and solar panels generate electricity 
                            through different mechanisms. Wind turbines harness 
                            the kinetic energy of the wind to turn blades, which 
                            then drive a generator. Solar panels convert sunlight 
                            into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. When 
                            integrated into a renewable energy system, these technologies 
                            complement each other by providing a continuous and reliable 
                            power supply. Wind power is often more abundant during certain 
                            times, while solar power is consistent during daylight hours, 
                            resulting in a more stable overall energy output.
